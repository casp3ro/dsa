def longest_consecutive(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Finds the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array.
    
    Interview Tips:
    - Use set for O(1) lookup
    - Only start counting from beginning of sequence (num-1 not in set)
    - Count consecutive numbers from each starting point
    - Key insight: only count from sequence starts to avoid O(nÂ²) complexity
    
    Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space
